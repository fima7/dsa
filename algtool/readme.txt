For a number A=a1a2…an⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯ with n digits create a corresponding polynomial a(x)=a1xn−1+a2xn−2+⋯+an. Then a(10)=A. Do the same with number B=b1b2…bn⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯ and create polynomial b(x). Multiply polynomials a(x) and b(x), get polynomial c(x) =c1c2…cn⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯. If we create a number C=c1c2…cn⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯, it is almost the same as product of A and B, but some of its "digits" may be 10 or bigger. If the last "digit" is 52, for example, make the last digit just 2 and add 5 to the previous digit. Go on until all the digits are from 0 to 9.

Suppose we need to multiply numbers 13 and 24. The correct result is 312. To get this result, we first create polynomials a(x)=x+3 and b(x)=2x+4 corresponding to numbers 13 and 24 respectively. We then use Karatsuba's algorithm to multiply those polynomials and get polynomial c(x)=2x2+10x+12. To get the answer, we need to compute c(10)=2×102+10×10+12. You see that some of the coefficients of polynomial c are not digits, because they are bigger than 9. To fix that, for each such coefficient from right to left we subtract 10 from it and add 1 to the previous coefficient: c(10)=2×102+10×10+12=2×102+11×10+2=3×102+1×10+2=312.
